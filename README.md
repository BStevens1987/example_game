Create a rock paper scissors playRound function that is made up of smaller functions. The game function allows the user to play rounds against the computer until either wins five rounds first. Allow the user to select their entry using one of three buttons ("Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors"). Display running score above the buttons and round results below the buttons. After either the user or the computer reaches 5 wins first, change the button function so that on the next click it alerts the user of the victor (who reached 5 wins first) and resets the scoreboard and round results.
